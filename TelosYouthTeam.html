            Telos Youth is currently co-owned by two Telos members:
        </p>
        <p class="paulcarter16ceo">
            Michael Paul, 17, Founder & Code Writer (50%) 
        </p>
        <p class="usmankhan16ceo">
            Usman Khan, 17, Founder & Designer (50%) 
        </p>
        <p class="teambodytext">
            Though on the surface, it may seem like we lack experience, our Block Producer, our site, and everything you see was organized and assembled by us. We both have knowledge in coding and have a huge interest in making decentralised infrastructures more common. We believe that we have come a long way and believe we are capable of leading the future and the young generation towards normalising better and deserved Telos software. We are currently both undertaking our A levels and believe that with your support, we can and will be suitable candidates for Telos.
